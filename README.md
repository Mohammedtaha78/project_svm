## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify data using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The dataset is preprocessed, and an SVM classifier is trained to predict target outcomes. The project explores different metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **SVM Model**: Implementation of SVM using Scikit-learn.
- **Model Evaluation**: Includes accuracy score, confusion matrix, precision, and recall metrics.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohammedtaha78/project_svm.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd project_svm
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To use the project:

1. Ensure that the dataset (`iphone_purchase_records.csv`) is in the correct location (e.g., `/content/iphone_purchase_records.csv`).
2. Run the main script or notebook to preprocess the data, train the SVM classifier, and evaluate the results.
3. Example of running the SVM Classifier:
   ```bash
   python svm_classifier.py
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is related to iPhone purchase records. It contains features such as gender, age, and income, and the target variable indicates whether a person purchased an iPhone.

## Model Training and Evaluation
- **Training**: The SVM model is trained on the preprocessed dataset.
- **Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using a test set. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix are calculated to assess the model's performance.

## Results
- Confusion Matrix: Provides an overview of true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative results.
- Accuracy Score: Indicates how well the model predicts the outcomes.
- Precision and Recall: Measure the performance of the classifier in detail, focusing on relevant predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for SVM implementation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
